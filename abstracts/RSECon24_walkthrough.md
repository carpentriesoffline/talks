## Title
OfflineDataSci - A Python Package for Managing Common Data Science Tools for Carpentries Workshops or Individual Users When Limited Access to the Internet is Anticipated

## Abstract
Managing and distributing learning materials in a teaching setting can pose challenges when Internet access is limited. To address this issue, we created and are further developing the CarpentriesOffline project. As part of the CarpentriesOffline project, the team is actively developing OfflineDataSci. OfflineDataSci is a Python package specifically designed for managing downloads of data science lessons materials and installers. It serves as a  resource for Carpentries workshops or for individual users who anticipate limited or no Internet access. In this practical session we will cover the installation and uses of OfflineDataSci which includes the following:

- Installers for data science languages: Currently R and Python

- Installers for common data science IDEs: Currently RStudio

- Partial local mirrors of package repositories: Currently CRAN (for R) and a PyPI (for Python)

- Locally browseable clones of data science teaching websites: Currently Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry



## Prerequisites
Attendees will need a laptop (Linux, Windows or Mac) with Python 2.10 or later installed. No programming knowledge is expected.

## Outcomes
The session will be run in a typical Carpentries live coding style. We will demonstrate while participants follow along on their own computers (online or in person). We will first do a walk through of how the OfflineDataSci Python package is installed and then how it is used to deliver workshops. If time allows we will allow for discussions of how people would like to use the package and what we can do to improve it. After this session an attendee should be able to install the offlinedatasci installer and be able to use command line instructions to download learning materials and software required for delivering Carpentries Workshops.

## Accessibility
The OfflineDataSci Python package is available on GitHub under the MIT license. The session will be run in a typical Carpentries live coding style. The software used will be a bash terminal and a web browser while the content will also be made available in a Carpentries style lesson (CC license). 
  
## Delivery Plan for a Hybrid Audience
Online participants should be able to follow along as in any online and in-person Carpentries style workshop. We hope that the two authors from the University of Florida will be able to attend the session to act as online helpers.
