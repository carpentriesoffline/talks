## Title of the lesson you would like to develop or the content you would like to work on

Building a miniHPC for delivering HPC Carpentries workshops

## If planning to start a new lesson, provide a brief motivation for its creation and description of its content

There are several problems with gaining access to an HPC to run a workshop for students. An alternative is to build a mini HPC out of single board computers (SBC) such as Raspberry Pi computers but this is not an easy task. This tutorial aims to introduce the CarpentriesOffline miniHPC solution which allow instructors without specialised HPC hardware and software knowledge to run HPC Carpentries workshops.
