## Title
Building a miniHPC for delivering HPC Carpentries and other HPC-related workshops

## Abstract
There are several problems with gaining access to an HPC to run a workshop for students. An alternative is to build a mini HPC out of single board computers (SBC) such as Raspberry Pi computers but this is not an easy task. This tutorial aims to introduce the CarpentriesOffline miniHPC solution which allow instructors without specialised HPC hardware and software knowledge to run HPC Carpentries workshops.


## Description
### Tutorial Goals
1. Introduction to CarpentriesOffline
2. Setting up an RPi
3. Identifying and installing the required software head node (login node)
4. Installing modules with EESSI
5. Identifying and installing the required software for compute nodes
6. Using the miniHPC to deliver workshops
7. Discussion and Q&A

### Relevance for conference attendees
The purpose of the miniHPC is to train users and administrators of HPCs. The miniHPC can also be used for the design and debugging of workflows. Thus, anyone with an interest in training or the development of pipelines would benefit from this session.

### Target audience
1. HPC Carpentries Instructors
2. HPC Admin workshop instructors
3. Developers of scripts and pipelines

### Content level
Intermediate

### Audience prerequisites
2. Basic knowledge of bash scripting
3. Basic knowledge of using HPCs
4. Basic knowledge of Linux and how to install software
