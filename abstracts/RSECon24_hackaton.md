## Abstract (250 words max)
***Enter an abstract of your submission. This should be a brief and attention-grabbing summary of your submission. For accepted submissions, these details will appear in the programme.***

There are several problems with gaining access to an HPC to run a workshop for students. An alternative is to build a mini HPC out of single board computers (SBC) such as Raspberry Pis but this is not an easy task. The first half of this workshop aims to introduce the CarpentriesOffline miniHPC solution which allow instructors without specialised HPC hardware and software knowledge to run HPC Carpentries workshops. Delivery of the workshop will be done in the typical Carpentries live coding style. The second half of the workshop will take the form of a hackerthon. There is still a great deal of development to be done for CarpentriesOffline which includes tasks such as modifications of existing Carpentries lessons, onboarding lessons for instructor in the CarpentriesOffline way, scripting of the miniHPC tasks and creating Rapsberry Pi images for writing to SD cards etc.

## Prerequisites (150 words max)
