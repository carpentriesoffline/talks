# CW25 Lightning Talk

## 4. Lightning talk title
Help Us Out Testing CarpentriesOffline

## 5. Abstract:
***Just 2-3 sentences to add context to your lightning talk title in Question 4. This will not be published anywhere, but will help us to review your submission.***

We would use the talk to encourage participants to help test the CarpentriesOffline server by asking them to connect to a CarpentriesOffline WiFi network. They should be able to connect to the access point, then navigate to a web page where they will find a form to provide some feedback as well as most of the Carpentries learning materials required for delivering workshops. 

## 6. Lightning talk theme(s)
***Does your lightning talk relate to any of the CW25 themes? (Select all that apply.)***

## 7. Is there any other information you want to include?
CarpentriesOffline is a project focussed on providing an infrastructure for running Carpentries workshops offline. It was the CW21 hackday winner and the subject of a 2022 SSI fellowship. Participation from attendees will help us test CarpentriesOffline on a wide variety of operating systems and web browsers and provide valuable feedback for deploying it in real world scenarios.
