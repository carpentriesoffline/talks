# Delivering Training with a mini HPC built from Raspberry Pis
## Author: Dr Jannetta S. Steyn
Building an HPC with Raspberry Pis might sound like something entertaining that you should do on a Sunday afternoon during that "long dark tea-time of the soul" but, in actual fact, it is no menial task.

In this presentation I'll walk the audience through the process of selecting hardware and software and the pitfalls in building a working mini HPC with single board computers such as the Raspberry Pi.

I will finally talk a bit about practical applications of the mini-HPC, particularly as a training tool where students can get to grips with a real HPC system in a safe setting where the consequences of making mistakes are minimal.
